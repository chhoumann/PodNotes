They have to be this way.

It was rude.

The whole experience was exhausting.

It could have been so much simpler.

But it wasn't, was it? And with them, the people we've all met, it just never is.

They make things complicated.

They say things that are hurtful.

They are totally oblivious to what they impose on others.

The Stoics dealt with these folks because these folks have always been with us.

A world without them is impossible.

And for them, being anything different than they are is impossible, too.

The sooner we accept this, the better.

The sooner we stop taking it personally, the less it will surprise you and the less it will hurt.

This is the job they have been given in this life, to be that kind of person, at least in this moment.

And our job, it's to understand that, to not let it get to us, to put up with them, to work around them, to not be like that.

Because we don't have to be.

We are lucky in that way.
